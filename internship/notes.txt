The main thing keeping this program working is the fact that it is
multithreaded. I have one thread continuously checking for user
input while another thread is checking the time every minute. This allows
scheduled and regular tasks so be executed at the same time. Furthermore, once
a program should be executed, a third thread is created to use the subprocess
module and carry out that programs execution. At any given time, there are n + 2
threads where n is the number of programs being executed.

Use army time for the config and make sure to update the program locations
based on where they are in your environment.

To run a program just enter the name in the command line.
